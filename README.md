## To-Do List

Here are some upcoming tasks we need to address:

- [ ] use GUI to display songs with name of the song and artist. Use this 
- [ ] .json the ASCII coding does not accept "tilde" this is strange 
- [ ] use separate thread to analize songs who are new so it does not take too long to load 
- [ ] bug If songsplayed.json is too big creating a new list
- [ ] guI windows for select directory of songs
